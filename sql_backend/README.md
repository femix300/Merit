## Project Overview

This project offers APIs to help students evaluate their scores for university admissions, determine whether they qualify for their chosen course, and get recommendations for other courses they might be eligible for based on their performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python (Flask)
- MySQL (Database)
- SQLAlchemy (ORM)
- Flask RESTful APIs
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

# Project Setup

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed on your system. It is also recommended to use a virtual environment for managing dependencies.

## Required Packages
The following packages are required for this project:

- **Flask**: Web framework  
- **Flask-Cors**: Extension for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Flask  
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database interaction  
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: Extension for using SQLAlchemy with Flask  
- **PyMySQL**: MySQL database connector  
- **PyInputPlus**: A library for handling user input validation  
- **google-generativeai**: SDK for interacting with Google Generative AI APIs  
- **google-ai-generativelanguage**: SDK for accessing Google's generative language models  

## Installation Steps

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Run the following command to create and activate a virtual environment:

#### Linux/macOS
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git clone https://github.com/femix300/Merit.git
cd Merit-backend
```


### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file includes the necessary dependencies for the project.

#### Key Packages:

- `Flask`: Web framework
- `SQLAlchemy`: ORM for database interaction
- `Flask-SQLAlchemy`: Extension for using SQLAlchemy with Flask
- `PyMySQL`: MySQL database connector

### Step 3: Running the Project

start the Flask development server:

```bash
# Export environment variables and run Flask
export FLASK_APP=run.py
flask run
```

This will start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
