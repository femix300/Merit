## Project Overview

Merit API serves as the backbone for a university admission assistance platform. It provides students with tools to:

- Evaluate their scores for university admissions.
- Verify qualification for chosen courses.
- Receive recommendations for alternative courses within the same faculty, based on performance metrics.
- Interact with an AI-powered chatbot for additional admissions-related queries.

This backend system is built with scalability, maintainability, and production readiness in mind, demonstrating strong backend engineering practices.

---

## Features

- **Score Evaluation:** Calculate and evaluate student scores for admission.
- **Course Eligibility Check:** Determine if a student qualifies for a chosen course.
- **Alternative Recommendations:** Suggest other courses within the same faculty.
- **AI Chatbot Interface:** Utilize Google Generative AI for an interactive chatbot experience.
- **Structured API Design:** Expose well-documented RESTful API endpoints for integrations.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Backend Framework:** Python (Flask)
- **Database:** MySQL, hosted on Railway in production.
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy for efficient database interactions.
- **API Design:** Flask RESTful APIs
- **Production Server:** Gunicorn
- **CORS:** Flask-Cors for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- **Frontend Assets:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **AI SDKs:**  
  - `google-generativeai` and `google-ai-generativelanguage` for chatbot functionality.

---

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** installed on your system.
- It is recommended to use a virtual environment for dependency management.
- Git for cloning the repository.

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/femix300/Merit.git
cd sql_backend
```

#### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file includes dependencies like Flask, SQLAlchemy, PyMySQL, Gunicorn, and the Google AI SDKs.

---

### Environment Variables

To configure your environment, you need to set the following variables. You can add them to your shell configuration file (like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`) or use a `.env` file.

```bash
export FLASK_ENV=development
export FLASK_APP=run.py
export SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
export MYSQLHOST=your_mysql_host
export MYSQLPORT=3306
export MYSQLUSER=your_mysql_user
export MYSQLPASSWORD=your_mysql_password
export MYSQLDATABASE=your_mysql_database
```

Load the variables using:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

---

### Local Deployment (Limitations)

This project can be run locally to explore the backend structure and codebase. However, **full functionality depends on access to the production database**, which is private. As such, certain features may not work locally without valid database credentials.

#### Steps to Set Up Locally
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/femix300/Merit.git
   cd sql_backend
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file or use your shell to set the following environment variables:
   ```bash
   export FLASK_ENV=development
   export FLASK_APP=run.py
   export SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   export MYSQL_HOST=your_mysql_host
   export MYSQL_PORT=3306
   export MYSQL_USER=your_mysql_user
   export MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
   export MYSQL_DATABASE=your_mysql_database
   ```
   **Note**: These values are private, and the backend will not function without valid credentials.

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   flask run or python3 run.py
   ```

### Production Deployment

For production deployment, the backend is configured to use **Gunicorn** as the WSGI server. Below are the steps to deploy the application:

#### Deployment Steps
1. **Set Up Hosting Environment**:
   - Use a cloud provider like Render, Railway, or Heroku for deployment.
   - Ensure the hosting environment supports Python and has the ability to set environment variables.

2. **Prepare Environment Variables**:
   - Set the same environment variables used for local development in the hosting provider's dashboard.
   - Ensure that the `FLASK_ENV` is set to `production`.

3. **Procfile**:
   - The project includes a `Procfile` for deployment, which specifies the command to run the application:
     ```text
     web: gunicorn wsgi:app
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   - The hosting service will automatically install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

5. **Run the Application**:
   - When deployed, the application will run on the hosting providerâ€™s specified domain (e.g., `https://merit-uc58.onrender.com`).

#### Example Deployment Command (Gunicorn)
To simulate the production environment locally, you can use the following command:
```bash
gunicorn wsgi:app
```

This simulates how the application will run in production using Gunicorn as the WSGI server.

#### Testing the API
If you do not have access to the database, you can still explore the codebase and learn about the endpoints described below. For full functionality, please reach out to the repository owner.

## Authentication Headers

For all protected routes, include the JWT token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>
```

**Example:**
```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoiNjBkNWY0ODRmMWIyYzhiMWY4ZTRhMWIyIiwiaWF0IjoxNjI0NTYwMDAwLCJleHAiOjE2MjQ1NjM2MDB9.signature
```

---

## Notes

1. **Base URL:** Replace `http://localhost:5000` with your actual server URL
2. **Content-Type:** Always include `Content-Type: application/json` header for POST/PATCH/PUT requests
3. **Token Expiry:** Access tokens have limited lifetime; use refresh token to get new access tokens
4. **Admin Routes:** Only users with `is_admin: true` can access admin-only endpoints
5. **User IDs:** All user IDs are MongoDB ObjectIds (24-character hexadecimal strings)
6. **Email Verification:** Users must verify their email before full account access
7. **Password Requirements:** Implement client-side password strength validation as needed

## Frontend Integration

The frontend interacts with the API via HTTP requests using JavaScript (e.g., `fetch` or Axios). The production API is hosted at `https://merit-uc58.onrender.com/`.

---

## Logging & Debugging

- **Local Development:** Logs are displayed in the terminal when `FLASK_ENV=development`.
- **Production Logs:** Can be monitored via the hosting providerâ€™s dashboard (e.g., Railway or Heroku).

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Automated Testing:** Add unit and integration tests for all endpoints.
- **Enhanced Chatbot:** Introduce more advanced AI features for user interaction.

---

## Remote MySQL Access

The production MySQL database is hosted on Railway. Ensure secure access by setting environment variables appropriately. Local development uses a separate MySQL instance to avoid conflicts.
